# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

OpenCut is a free, open-source video editor built with Next.js, focusing on privacy (no server processing), multi-track timeline editing, and real-time preview. The project is a monorepo using Turborepo with multiple apps including a web application, desktop app (Tauri), background remover tools, and transcription services.

## Essential Commands

**Development:**
```bash
# Root level development
bun dev                    # Start all apps in development mode
bun build                  # Build all apps
bun lint                   # Lint all code using Ultracite
bun format                 # Format all code using Ultracite

# Web app specific (from apps/web/)
cd apps/web
bun run dev                # Start Next.js development server with Turbopack
bun run build              # Build for production
bun run lint               # Run Biome linting
bun run lint:fix           # Fix linting issues automatically
bun run format             # Format code with Biome

# Database operations (from apps/web/)
bun run db:generate        # Generate Drizzle migrations
bun run db:migrate         # Run migrations
bun run db:push:local      # Push schema to local development database
bun run db:push:prod       # Push schema to production database
```

**Testing:**
- No unified test commands are currently configured
- Individual apps may have their own test setups

## Architecture & Key Components

### State Management
The application uses **Zustand** for state management with separate stores for different concerns:
- **editor-store.ts**: Canvas presets, layout guides, app initialization
- **timeline-store.ts**: Timeline tracks, elements, playback state
- **media-store.ts**: Media files and asset management
- **playback-store.ts**: Video playback controls and timing
- **project-store.ts**: Project-level data and persistence
- **panel-store.ts**: UI panel visibility and layout
- **keybindings-store.ts**: Keyboard shortcut management
- **sounds-store.ts**: Audio effects and sound management
- **stickers-store.ts**: Sticker/graphics management

### Storage System
**Multi-layer storage approach:**
- **IndexedDB**: Projects, saved sounds, and structured data
- **OPFS (Origin Private File System)**: Large media files for better performance
- **Storage Service** (`lib/storage/`): Abstraction layer managing both storage types

### Editor Architecture
**Core editor components:**
- **Timeline Canvas**: Custom canvas-based timeline with tracks and elements
- **Preview Panel**: Real-time video preview (currently DOM-based, planned binary refactor)
- **Media Panel**: Asset management with drag-and-drop support
- **Properties Panel**: Context-sensitive element properties

### Media Processing
- **FFmpeg Integration**: Client-side video processing using @ffmpeg/ffmpeg
- **Background Removal**: Python-based tools with multiple AI models (U2Net, SAM, Gemini)
- **Transcription**: Separate service for audio-to-text conversion

## Development Focus Areas

**✅ Recommended contribution areas:**
- Timeline functionality and UI improvements
- Project management features
- Performance optimizations
- Bug fixes in existing functionality
- UI/UX improvements outside preview panel
- Documentation and testing

**⚠️ Areas to avoid (pending refactor):**
- Preview panel enhancements (fonts, stickers, effects)
- Export functionality improvements
- Preview rendering optimizations

**Reason:** The preview system is planned for a major refactor from DOM-based rendering to binary rendering for consistency with export and better performance.

## Code Quality Standards

**Linting & Formatting:**
- Uses **Biome** for JavaScript/TypeScript linting and formatting
- Extends **Ultracite** configuration for strict type safety and AI-friendly code
- Comprehensive accessibility (a11y) rules enforced
- Zero configuration approach with subsecond performance

**Key coding standards from Ultracite:**
- Strict TypeScript with no `any` types
- No React imports (uses automatic JSX runtime)
- Comprehensive accessibility requirements
- Use `for...of` instead of `Array.forEach`
- No TypeScript enums, use const objects
- Always include error handling with try-catch

## Environment Setup

**Required environment variables (apps/web/.env.local):**
```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://opencut:opencutthegoat@localhost:5432/opencut"

# Authentication
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET="your-generated-secret-here"
BETTER_AUTH_URL="http://localhost:5555"

# Redis
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL="http://localhost:8079"
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN="example_token"

# Content Management
MARBLE_WORKSPACE_KEY="workspace-key"
NEXT_PUBLIC_MARBLE_API_URL="https://api.marblecms.com"
```

**Docker services:**
```bash
# Start local database and Redis
docker-compose up -d
```

## Project Structure

**Monorepo layout:**
- `apps/web/` - Main Next.js application
- `apps/desktop/` - Tauri desktop application
- `apps/bg-remover/` - Python background removal tools
- `apps/transcription/` - Audio transcription service
- `packages/` - Shared packages (auth, database)

**Web app structure:**
- `src/components/` - React components organized by feature
- `src/stores/` - Zustand state management
- `src/hooks/` - Custom React hooks
- `src/lib/` - Utility functions and services
- `src/types/` - TypeScript type definitions
- `src/app/` - Next.js app router pages and API routes

## Common Patterns

**Error handling:**
```typescript
try {
  const result = await processData();
  return { success: true, data: result };
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Operation failed:', error);
  return { success: false, error: error.message };
}
```

**Store usage:**
```typescript
const { tracks, addTrack, updateTrack } = useTimelineStore();
```

**Media processing:**
```typescript
import { processVideo } from '@/lib/ffmpeg-utils';
const processedVideo = await processVideo(inputFile, options);
```
